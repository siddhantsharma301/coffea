Using JavaFX and advanced data structures, we're going to create a new kind of music player that looks and sounds great.

This project is the independent project of Rahul Deshpande and Siddhant Sharma for the AP CS A class at California High School.

# Objective 
This application is designed with a grandparent or another elderly person in mind. See, many old people feel overwhelmed by features in a modern music player. From Radio, to accounts, to licensing, et cetera, it can get to be a bit much. This is why we created the Coffea player. It sports an intuitive interface designed from the ground up for seniors— large text with high contrast helps a user see elements easier and large buttons allow for easy clicking.

  - You can select songs in the mp3 or wav file format
  - The computer’s file system is used to select files (songs) to play
            
3. Skipping and returning to previous songs
  - The backwards button is used to play songs that were previously played in the session
  - The forwards button is used to play songs that were added after the current song.
    - If the current song is the last song, pressing the forward button will not do anything
            
 Note: If the mp3 file does not come with the correct metadata, the album cover and/or song name will not appear.
